## Changelog

### 2.1 -- Released October 1st, 2017

Thank you @brandons for the Swift 4 PR! 
Version 2.1 is simply our update to Swift 4.
Will also have a Swift 3.2 branch for those not yet on Swift 4.

### Pre 2.1

I apologize but we did not keep a changelog before version 2.1.
The git history is the best place to look for that info I'm afraid!
