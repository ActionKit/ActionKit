Back to [main readme](README.md)

This is a small bump for podspec change to specify .swift files

### 2.3.1 -- Released November 30th, 2017

This is purely a bump to update documentation regarding using 
Xcode's new build system

### 2.3 -- Released November 1st, 2017

Where did 2.2 go? Well, it was in the middle there without much change.
This version fixes https://github.com/ActionKit/ActionKit/issues/31
Thanks for the reports, and the screenshot helped a lot!

### 2.1 -- Released October 1st, 2017

Thank you @brandons for the Swift 4 PR! 
Version 2.1 is simply our update to Swift 4.
Will also have a Swift 3.2 branch for those not yet on Swift 4.

### Pre 2.1

I apologize but we did not keep a changelog before version 2.1.
The git history is the best place to look for that info I'm afraid!
