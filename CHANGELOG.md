Back to [main readme](README.md)

### 2.5.2 -- Released May 3rd, 2019

Thanks again @RomanPodymov for this release! This adds tvos support to ActionKit.

### 2.5.1 -- Released January 6th, 2019

Thanks @RomanPodymov for this release! This bumps the swift-version to 4.2 correctly, removing the deprecated .swift-version file. 
It also adopts the updated Hashable APIs.

### 2.5.0 -- Released January 1st, 2019

Happy 2019! Version 2.5 is a big bug fix to allow for actions for multiple `controlEvent` types for a single `UIControl`.
The bug would trigger all actions for any controlEvent, but this is no longer the case! Thanks @marcusbuffett for reporting this :)
Along with this release, I've also removed the `swift4` branch. Once Swift 5 is out, the `swift3.2` branch will also be cleaned up, and we'll have a Swift 4.x branch left open. 

### 2.4.0 -- Released September 21st, 2018

Version 2.4 is all about supporting Swift 4.2.
Please use the `swift4` branch to continue using Swift 4 APIs.

### 2.3.2 -- Released December 1st, 2017

This is a small bump for podspec change to specify .swift files

### 2.3.1 -- Released November 30th, 2017

This is purely a bump to update documentation regarding using 
Xcode's new build system

### 2.3 -- Released November 1st, 2017

Where did 2.2 go? Well, it was in the middle there without much change.
This version fixes https://github.com/ActionKit/ActionKit/issues/31
Thanks for the reports, and the screenshot helped a lot!

### 2.1 -- Released October 1st, 2017

Thank you @brandons for the Swift 4 PR! 
Version 2.1 is simply our update to Swift 4.
Will also have a Swift 3.2 branch for those not yet on Swift 4.

### Pre 2.1

I apologize but we did not keep a changelog before version 2.1.
The git history is the best place to look for that info I'm afraid!
